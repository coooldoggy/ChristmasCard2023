## About This Project 🤯
This project started to make ChristMasCard🎅🏻 for my friends using KMP Wasm.
However, lack of resources and library I couldn't make it on time....
So I will keep making this project and send this card next year lol :) 😂 

## What I have suffered 
- Lottie is Not supported in wasm 🥲
- Finding Library that can replace lottie 😶‍🌫️
  - [Trial]
  - Skiko : JetBrain Library -> Cannot use this because I cannot use Java.io.File, So I tried to use JS fuction as external function but I failed. Worth to retry 🥺
  - Kamel : I dunno why yet. Should have to figure it out
